# Scenario C: Applicant who missed the deadline

Hi Anne,

Thanks for your interest in joining our Summer Interview Prep Course.
As much as we want to make our courses available to as many people as possible, we are sorry to inform you that the application for this course has been closed two weeks ago. We would be open to making considerations but unfortunately for this class, the slots have been taken up and we already have a long waitlist for this.

We know internship applications can be daunting and we want to help you with that. Feel free to check our [high-level software interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) containing tips and guidelines that can be helpful in your internship interview journey. If you want, you can also sign up to our mailing list [here](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) to get notified of future courses, upcoming events, and career fairs that you might be interested in. 

We wish you all the best in all of your career endeavors and we want to congratulate you in advance on your graduation!


All the best,

CodePath.org Team
