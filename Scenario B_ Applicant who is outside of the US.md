# Scenario B: Applicant who is outside of the US

Hi Jane,

Thanks for applying to our Android Mobile Development Course. We appreciate your interest! 

Based on the current sponsorships we receive as a non-profit organization, our courses as of the moment are **only available to students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States**. Currently, we run programs in other countries such as Haiti and we also used to run classes in Taiwan. But with the interest of applicants outside the US, we are eager to reach all of you and expand to more countries in the near future. 

We appreciate your efforts in processing your application and we want to thank you for the time and energy you invested in applying. We can notify you once classes become available in your area powered by local organizers or through remote means. You can sign up for our mailing list [here](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) if you wish to get notified. 
 
In the meantime, there are a lot of resources out there for people interested in learning Android, and weâ€™ve done some work to make them more accessible. We have many [online resources for learning Android](https://support.codepath.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-can-i-get-started-learning-android-development-online) including an extensive list of [Android resources online](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Beginning-Android-Resources#beginning-android-resources).

We hope to be able to bring programs to your area soon and expand our audience for future programs. Thanks for your understanding, 

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
