# Scenario A: Request to bump up to Advanced Track


Hi John,

Congratulations on your admission to the Summer Technical Interview Prep Course (Intermediate Track)!

In CodePath, our team has worked so hard to create and curate each of the classes to ensure that our students enter the track that is most suited for them. We are attentive to the individual experience and skill set of each of our students as we want all of you to get the best and highly personalized experience possible.

In line with this, we want to let you know that we cannot grant your request of transferring to the Advance Track. But don't worry, as both of these tracks share the same purpose of helping you pursue your best future by preparing you to solve challenging algorithm problems in real whiteboard interviews at top companies.

We welcome you to this Summer Technical Interview Prep Course and we are excited to see you!




All the best,
CodePath.org Team
