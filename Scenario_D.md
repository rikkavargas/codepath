# Scenario D: Student who wants to be put back to the course after being withdrawn

Hi Dennis,

We are glad to hear from you again!

As you know, our courses focus on developing student's habits and skills in order to be successful in the tech industry. The ability to be punctual, meet project deadlines and work effectively in a collaborative team are equally important skills.

We wanted to know your plans with the assignment and the course last time when we reached to you via email, as we can still allow one late submission within the extended deadline. But we did not get any feedback from you and so we proceeded to removing you from the class due to non-compliance of our [course policy](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19).

We have moved your status into an Observer role where you still retain *lifetime access* to the course material using the Github login credentials you used to sign up for our course. Also, you will no longer be asked to submit weekly coursework and will not be able to attend the live sessions.


All the best,

CodePath.org Team
